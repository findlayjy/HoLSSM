# Corpus of the UK House of Lords debates on same-sex marriage 
(HoLSSM /ˈhɒlsəm/)
[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

This is the data used in Findlay (2017). The corpus is divided into four, depending on the speaker's position with respect to marriage reform (`pro`, `against`, `equiv`ocal), or whether the contribution does not relate to the question being debated (`other`). The `pro` and `against` sub-corpora also have `keywords` and `wordlist` files. See the paper for full details.


If you wish to use the data, please cite the paper as below.
